1. Project Title
Cervical Cancer Detection using CNN and Python

2. Description
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect cervical cancer from medical images.
It uses deep learning techniques for classification and prediction.
Developed in Python using VS Code as the IDE.

4. Features

CNN model for classification
Training, validation, and testing phases
Visualization of results (Accuracy, Loss Curves)
User-friendly interface (if applicable)

5. Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)
